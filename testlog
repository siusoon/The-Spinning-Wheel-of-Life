#27 Apr 2016 [Working on Pi - Model B+ technically]
- With the latest Carnivore for ARM, it supports PI now: https://github.com/RSG/Carnivore. Thx to RSG and Gottfried!
- make sure it is root access (sudo processing or sudo ./processing > to run processing as root)
* I also did a tcpdump update in Pi (get update and tcpdump) http://www.ronnutter.com/raspberry-pi-intro-to-tcpdump/
> other fixes are required: the visual throbber seems a bit distored in PI interface
>> next action [hardware]: Get the Pi 3 with better CPU power and test again.
