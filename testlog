#19 Sep 2016 [Tried Pi 3 Model B > things work on Processing 3.2.1]
>> work out much better than Pi 2, but still a bit unstable that needs to fix
steps: 
- for AU internet, just use FB login with AU-Guest
- For new pi installation- do the update first https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md
- Download processing (as I have experienced SSL certificate problem and can't use the function curl or curl -k, I download it via processing.org site. seee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LShej4l2rjM)
- to run processing, go to the directory (terminal) and type: sudo ./processing  (if error encountered, need to uninstall package by typing: sudo aptitude remove libgles2-mesa)
- In processing, add library > select Carnivore
- playlist web page: http://bit.ly/1ppETHQ
- Download The Spinning-Wheel-of-Life 

#28 Apr 2016 [Tried ad blocking in Youtube successfully]
- Firefox addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-enhancer-plus/
- remove interrupted video ad between videos in a playlist
- Every time installing the work, it always need to adjust framerate + alpha value due to different network connections and computer architecture.
>> next action [software]: clear outstanding/queued packets at a certain time

#27 Apr 2016 [Working on Pi - Model B+ technically]
- With the latest Carnivore for ARM, it supports PI now: https://github.com/RSG/Carnivore. Thx to RSG and Gottfried!
- make sure it is root access (sudo processing or sudo ./processing > to run processing as root)
* I also did a tcpdump update in Pi (get update and tcpdump) http://www.ronnutter.com/raspberry-pi-intro-to-tcpdump/
> other fixes are required: the visual throbber seems a bit distored in PI interface
>> next action [hardware]: Get the Pi 3 with better CPU power and test again.

#25 Apr 2016 [doesn't work with Pi because it is not 64-bit- library is not supported] 
- Install processing in Raspberry Pi Model B+ (https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/now-available-for-download-processing/)
- In processing, add library > select Carnivore
