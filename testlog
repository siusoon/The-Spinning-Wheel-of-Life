#10 Dec 2016 [Major bug fix]
- Fix the missing ellipse issue, it was the misuse of variable counter in calulating the radius. 
- Minor fix on class name from particle system to packet system. It helps for my thinking logic
- Tried different network conditions e.g home broadband / 4G Lite (mobile). It behaves very differently. It also seems that few parameters need to tune as per the network conidtion to achieve the visual balance
mobile: (Download Speed: 17939 kbps (2242.4 KB/sec transfer rate))
home broadband: (Download Speed: 13163 kbps (1645.4 KB/sec transfer rate))
- [important discovery] Setting the MTU value helps in changing the no of packet delivery (command: sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1200 up)
- The video loop issue is not working, and this needs to fix again.

#8 Dec 2016 [Fixing code]
- change to check receiver IP than sender IP (assume only proceed for those packet send from others to local)
- clean up code 
- swap back to 2D canvas  
- to solve the loop issue of youtube, try this: https://www.youtube.com/embed?listType=playlist&list=PLk6nqLYChSfG7N0kUWyKq_zraDMrWCDun&loop=1&autoplay=1

#5 Dec 2016 [Worked with other mini screen]
- The pi works well with the new Kuman 7" screen: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01F3K57XG/ref=cfb_at_prodpg
- seems fix the spinning issue. The visual is highly distorted by the frameRate. Seemingly, it can't be set lower than 10.
- disable screen blank:sudo nano xxxxxxx then Re start the file or just reboot >> http://generativeaesthetics.blogspot.dk/search?updated-min=2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=50
- recapped few things to fix
>> block youtube ad > update Epiphany > disable ad (preference) > monitor
>> adjust the speed of spinning > ongoing
>> Youtube Ips 
>> fix the spinning ellipes (or rethink the design)
>> laser cut for mounting
>> tried loop playlist: http://ia800202.us.archive.org/10/items/YoutubePlaylistLooper/youtube_playlist_looper.html

#22 Sep 2016 [Worked with mini screen]  
- The pi works quite well with the 7" screen: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-5-800x480-tft-hdmi-monitor-touchscreen-backpack/overview
- minor config is need to be done for 800x480 (both processing program and Pi config.txt), see: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-5-800x480-tft-hdmi-monitor-touchscreen-backpack/raspberry-pi-config
>> Youtube can't auto play and stop, suspecting it is the ad problem. 

#20 Sep 2016 [Worked with 3.5 audio jack external speaker]
- type "sudo raspi-config" to force from HDMI to 3.5 audio jack
- check out screen 7": http://www.waveshare.com/product/7inch-hdmi-lcd-b.htm
- other source for forcing awake and web browser: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=150080

#19 Sep 2016 [Tried Pi 3 Model B > things work on Processing 3.2.1]
>> work out much better than Pi 2, but still a bit unstable that needs to fix (in terms of the program, load test, visual part)
steps: 
- for AU internet, just use FB login with AU-Guest
- For new pi installation- do the update first https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md
- Download processing (as I have experienced SSL certificate problem and can't use the function curl or curl -k, I download it via processing.org site. seee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LShej4l2rjM)
- to run processing, go to the directory (terminal) and type: sudo ./processing  (if error encountered, need to uninstall package by typing: sudo aptitude remove libgles2-mesa)
- In processing, add library > select Carnivore
- playlist web page: http://bit.ly/1ppETHQ
- Download The Spinning-Wheel-of-Life 
>> think of a pi screen for installation

#28 Apr 2016 [Tried ad blocking in Youtube successfully]
- Firefox addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-enhancer-plus/
- remove interrupted video ad between videos in a playlist
- Every time installing the work, it always need to adjust framerate + alpha value due to different network connections and computer architecture.
>> next action [software]: clear outstanding/queued packets at a certain time

#27 Apr 2016 [Working on Pi - Model B+ technically]
- With the latest Carnivore for ARM, it supports PI now: https://github.com/RSG/Carnivore. Thx to RSG and Gottfried!
- make sure it is root access (sudo processing or sudo ./processing > to run processing as root)
* I also did a tcpdump update in Pi (get update and tcpdump) http://www.ronnutter.com/raspberry-pi-intro-to-tcpdump/
> other fixes are required: the visual throbber seems a bit distored in PI interface
>> next action [hardware]: Get the Pi 3 with better CPU power and test again. -> DONE 

#25 Apr 2016 [doesn't work with Pi because it is not 64-bit- library is not supported] 
- Install processing in Raspberry Pi Model B+ (https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/now-available-for-download-processing/)
- In processing, add library > select Carnivore
